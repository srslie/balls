# Bouncing Balls

Recently I went to the [website](https://sokpop.co/) of a game developing collective who put out cute games that I rather like. Gosh was it freaking cute! And cool.

I had to learn how it worked. The best thing about front-end development is that often the javascript is right there in the dev tools source folder, just waiting for curious minds.

CSS is not my forte--I'm often very slow and haphazard and excited to get on to clean, logical data manipulation (ignore that shapes are data). But I'm pushing myself to explore more to grow in an area I'm not as comfortable, and take advantage of some of those tangilbe coolnesses that front-end has to offer.

Additionally, I've recently discovered that one of my weak points is project management. My inexperience as a coder means I underestimate how long things will take and the side-effects of working on each bug. I tend to flow-state program: I start working where it seems to make sense, notice something along the way, fiddle about with that, learn about a new thing to incoporate, start a branch, now there's a bug, go fix it, well that broke this, start another branch, wait I should restructure, go over here...

...it's not pretty and definitely something I hope to get better at through 1) practicing better prioritization and ticket issues 2) getting a project manager please hire me please 3) using the pain of how slow/sloppy/rough-going it is without good planning and workflow to convince me I should (beyond intellectually, yes I know I SHOULD do that, but the flow feels so good and right at the time, it would take longer to write a ticket than just go fix it right?)

Anyway, fun project, make some divs that are balls and figure out how to make 'em bounce off walls or each other and pulse and be able to drag them and make them change size when thrown and stuff; it's all cool as heck.
